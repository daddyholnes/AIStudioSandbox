# Duplicate Files Report

## WebSocket Client Files
1. **Keep**: `src/utils/websocketClient.js`
   - This file contains a comprehensive WebSocket client implementation with automatic reconnection and keep-alive functionality.
   
2. **Remove**: `src/websocketClient.js`
   - This file provides a basic WebSocket connection utility that lacks advanced features.

## WebSocket Server Implementation
1. **Keep**: `server/services/websocket.ts`
   - This file handles WebSocket connections and includes logging and message processing.

2. **Review**: 
   - `server/index.ts` and `server/index.js` for potential conflicts or duplicate WebSocket handling logic.

## Configuration Files
- No duplicates found for `vite.config.ts` or `postcss.config.js`.

## Recommendations
- Remove the identified duplicate WebSocket client file to streamline the codebase.
- Ensure that the WebSocket server implementation is consistent and does not have conflicting logic in the index files.

This report summarizes the findings and recommendations for cleaning up duplicate files in the codebase.
